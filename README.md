# My Vim Setup
If you want to use my vimrc (for vim) or init.vim (for Neovim), feel free to clone this repository and please follow the instructions to make sure it works properly.

1. Create ~/.config/nvim/ directory and move init.vim file inside /nvim directory.
2. coc-settings.json also should be under ~/.config/nvim/ directory.
3. Hit 'cd' to go back to home directory and create .nvim directory. 
4. Inside .nvim directory, create two subdirectories (/plugged and /undodir).
5. After following the above steps, go to init.vim and source it (:so %)


Enjoy!
